      "Howdy! You can call me Eve or Pretender—that’s what I go by online (and in my head, lol). I’m a 22-year-old gal who uses she/her pronouns, and I live in Texas, aka cowboy land. Yeehaw! 🤠🐄 <br><br> I’m extremely online, which is one reason I created this website. I’ve always been a creative person, even if my skills aren’t perfect—I have to express myself somehow! My journey started with Carrd, but I wanted more freedom, so here we are.<br><br> A little about me: I love gaming, drawing, writing, roleplaying, and yapping about my hyperfixations.",
